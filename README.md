# Regex in Javascript: Tutorial by Juan Apatiga

## Description 

You will learn how to validate the highlighted email address regular expression (regex) in this Regex Tutorial. Regex This Tutorial Includes: /([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([da-z.-]+).([a-z.]2,6)$/. The course simplifies the validation process by providing a full analysis and explanation of each component within the regex. After completing this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of how regex works to validate and confirm the entering of a legitimate email address.

## The Challenge 

 In this challenge, you will take what you learned in the course to create a comprehensive instructional on email validation using regex. To accomplish this, the following procedures were taken:

1. A detailed literature research on the structure and format of email addresses was conducted.
2. Using information from peer-reviewed sources, I identified the necessary components that must be checked in an email address.
3. Created a regex pattern that validates email addresses based on the components identified.
4. Create a GitHub Gist using the instructions in the "Installation Process" section.
5. Compose a brief explanation of the regex pattern produced for email validation in the newly formed Gist, outlining each component and its role in the validation process. This explanation was based on academic literature and was designed for new coders and other academics.
6. Share link to the Gist with others so that we may discuss various methods and understandings of the regex pattern.

4. University of Toronto Libraries. (n.d.). OpenRefine tutorial 3: Regular expressions (Regex) activity. https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/openrefine-tutorial-3-regular-expressions-regex-activity


These resources provided useful information on the design and implementation of regex patterns for email validation, as well as insights into the pedagogical elements of teaching regex to novice coders and other academics. This understanding was included into the development of the comprehensive lesson, which attempted to provide an understandable yet academically rigorous explanation of email validation using regex.

## User Story

```md
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```

## Built With: 

* GitHub Gist
* VS Code 

## What I Leanred 

1. GitHub Gist
2. Leanred knowledge on Regex patterns (email)
3. Tried my best to communicate my knowledge on the research I did

## Continuded Developement: 

1. Expand my Knowledge on this topic
2. Enchance the tutorial I created with more examples
